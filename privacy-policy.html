  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    [ColorClash] ("we," "our," or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our game. By using our game, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect or store any personal data from users. Our game does not include:
    <ul>
      <li>User accounts or authentication.</li>
      <li>Databases or persistent storage of any kind.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you connect to the game server using a socket connection, only minimal and necessary technical information may be processed temporarily to establish the connection, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Your IP address (used solely for communication during your session).</li>
      <li>Non-identifiable technical data like device type or connection status.</li>
    </ul>
    This information is not stored or shared and is discarded once the session ends.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    The technical information mentioned above is used exclusively to:
    <ul>
      <li>Facilitate the real-time operation of the game.</li>
      <li>Ensure a stable and functional connection.</li>
    </ul>
    We do not use this information for any other purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Our game does not store or retain any user data. All data exchanged during the socket connection is temporary and is deleted when your session ends.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Our game does not integrate or rely on any third-party services that collect, store, or process user data.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We prioritize the security of the socket connection by implementing standard encryption protocols to protect the data exchanged during your gameplay. However, please note that no online transmission method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our game is designed for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately, and we will take appropriate steps to address the issue.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our game or legal requirements. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
